[GRU_based_Large_Size_EEG_Classifier]

* Programming Language: Python
* Contact: S. Hwang (sunny16@yonsei.ac.kr)
* Function: This program is Gated Recurrent Unit based EEG classifier for a large size EEG data classification. The program include a simple example for 40 class subject-independent EEG classification. These codes include the Gated Recurrent Unit, dataset loader (public dataset from PeRCeiVe laboratory), and Training scheme. During Training, we evaluate the trained model.
