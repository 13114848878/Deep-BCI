<Brainwave_Entrainment_Program_based_on_Binaural_Beat_and_ASMR_Trigger>

* Programming Language: MATLAB
* Contact: C.-B. Song (cb_song@korea.ac.kr)
* Function: This program aims to entrain brainwaves based on a combined auditory stimulus with a binaural beat and an autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) trigger. Especially, these codes measure the sound pressure level of an auditory stimulus and adjust the decibel ratio between a binaural beat and an ASMR trigger to produce a combined auditory stimulus. Also, spectral analysis and statistical analysis are enable through these codes.
