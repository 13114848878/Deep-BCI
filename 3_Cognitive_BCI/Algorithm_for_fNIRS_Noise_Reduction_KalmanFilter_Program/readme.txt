*Programming Language: MATLAB

*Function: We provide an efficient noise reduction method using short separation channel (shourt-detector : 1 cm) in functional near infrared spectroscopy. We designed a non-linear state space model based on the Balloon model to estimate state using the extended Kalman filter. The method can reduce superficial noises in long separation channel.
