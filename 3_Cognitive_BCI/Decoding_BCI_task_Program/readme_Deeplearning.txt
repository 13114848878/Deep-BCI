*Function: This program provides a source code for decoding brain-computer interface (BCI) 
tasks from brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
You can make deep neural networks using KERAS deep learning package and evaluate cross-validated 
accuracies using this program.
