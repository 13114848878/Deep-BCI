* Programming Language: LABVIEW
* Contact: S.-T. Yang (hilton99@dgist.ac.kr)
* Function: This program can output various single signals by adjusting waveform (triangle wave, sawtooth wave, square wave, sinusoidal wave), amplitude and frequency.
            In addition, the signal can be output by increasing or decreasing the frequency or amplitude constantly. These signals can be monitored. Using these signals, the haptic actuator can be operated to display various tactile stimuli.
            In addition, tactile stimulation can be displayed at regular intervals.
