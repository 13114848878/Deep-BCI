* Programming Language: LABVIEW
* Contact: S.-T. Yang (hilton99@dgist.ac.kr)
* Function: This program can monitor and store PPG data. You can also use the external trigger signal (two voice stimulus triggers and two button triggers) to determine the state of consciousness.
            These trigger signals can be saved with PPG data. In addition, you can stop saving data using the external stop button trigger.
