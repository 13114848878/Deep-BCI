<Algorithm_for_Multimodal_BCI_based_on_BCI>

* Programming Language: MATLAB
* Contact: Y.-J. Kim (kyj140511@korea.ac.kr)
* Function: We provide a simple motor imagery (MI) analysis. These codes can extract the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) and features in the time-frequency domain. These features can also be used to classify multi-classes of MI.
